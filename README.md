### Helper scripts in Python for Megatron
The Python code in Megatron must be refactored before it can be publish on GitHub.

In the meantime, the follwing two Python-scripts are available in the [release tarball](https://github.com/cert-se/megatron-java#download): 
* Mega-sender: Sends mail-jobs in batch. Useful when automating abuse handling. 
* Data source handler: Downloads a HTML-page or RSS-feed, parse content, extracts data using XPath, and writes the result to a file which can be processed by Megatron.
